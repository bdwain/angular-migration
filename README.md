# angular-migration

setup: 

`yarn install`

`yarn start`

you can use npm too if you prefer

there are 3 branches to work from with different tasks that I worked on in the demo.

step 1: Convert the pizza component to react, and use it from the angular page2 component.

step 2: Use redux from the angular Service to keep the data in sync across both pages. Also fix the router so that you can switch between pages.

step 3: Convert the remaining Angular components and remove angular from the project.
